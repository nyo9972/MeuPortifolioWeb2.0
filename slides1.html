	   <p> Talking about the main projects that I have developed, I can mention as my first system the GFM (Fleet Management), as the name says, it is a fleet management system developed exclusively for the company MÓVEIS PONTAROLLO, the system was fully developed using C #, C ++ and .Net Framework 4.5 technologies, this system has the function of controlling all fleet costs even with documentation and fines, generating control and decision making reports. This system currently manages about 50 vehicles from 29 different branches and the expense management of a company's own mechanics. </p>
	   <p> I can also talk about Ivy, a customer service chatboot also developed exclusively for the same company, Ivy serves about 16 thousand customers a year directing to store salespeople, this reduced the cost of employees to respond these messages, in addition to reducing lost sales due to lack of agile response, after all Ivy works 24 hours a day, feel free to test the system send a message on WhatsApp +55 42 9865-9350. </p>
	   <p> I also developed the first tourism blog in Prudentópolis, when it was triggering for the technology area, take a look at the blog <a href="https://infoturprudentopolis.blogspot.com/"> Infortur Prudentópolis </a> nowadays the blog reaches about a thousand monthly views with it is found all the information about posadas, accommodations, restaurants, tourist spots among many other useful information for those who want to have fun in the land of giant waterfalls. </p>
	   <p> I implemented a security framework based on Debian, Pfsense, OpenMediaVault systems with Rsync backup and a Dell R540 server with virtualisations and RAID 1 for a new ERP system project for MÓVEIS PONTAROLLO and a NAS server for file security the accounting, administrative, inventory, assistance and etc. sectors </p>
